Abstract
===
The team’s sponsor, John Dunning, owns an Electric Vehicle. The electric vehicle market is young, as is the research and testing on the cars themselves. Most EV owners know the most expensive component in their vehicles is the battery, and would like to know when the battery will fail. By experimenting with data from the OBD II port in Dr. Dunning’s Nissan Leaf (2013 EV) the team will create a Android app to interface with a Bluetooth module to receive OBD data. The program will collect data focused on battery pack voltage, battery pack current, motor RPM, and state of charge to help John Dunning find trends in the battery over time. Hopefully, these trends can be used to estimate the life of his battery.
